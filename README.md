# SoA_vs_AoS
This repository contains a C++ program simulating thousands of quantum particles with properties (position, momentum, spin) using two memory layouts: Array of Structs (AoS) and Struct of Arrays (SoA). It implements computations (e.g., phase summation, spin updates), benchmarks memory usage and iteration speed, and analyzes cache efficiency.
